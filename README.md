PWA to remove image metadata.

Why?
--

When you take a photo with your camera a lot of metadata are added, including GPS position and date.
If you share this image as is, data can be collected by the third party and be used to track you.

This application allow to create a copy of your images without any information about you or your device.

How it works?
---

Image Only process the images in your browser and creates a copy to be saved. No data is send anywhere.
Image Only works completely offline and can be installed in your device as a PWA (Progressive Web App).
