Why?
--

When you take a photo with your camera a lot of metadata are added, including GPS position and date.
If you share this image as is, data can be collected by the third party and be used to track you.

This application allow you create a copy of your images without any information about you or your device.

How its works?

Image Only process the images in your browser and creates a copy to be saved. No data is send anywhere.
Image Only works completely offline and can be installed as a PWA (Progressive Web App).
